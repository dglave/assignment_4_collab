### Expanding longer with "uncount()" function. Row with "45" lobsters, will now be 45 observations. Removed "count" row and gives each counted lobster its own rown

lobster_tidy <- lobster_abundance %>% 
  tidyr::uncount(count)
```


```{r}
#### Each lobster now has its own row. 1 variable per column, 1 observation per row AND 1 measurement per cell. 

#### Adding a new column to show the year and month name of each lobster observation: 


#### Parsed date_new column to get month and year separated. 

lobster_parse_date <- lobster_tidy %>% 
  mutate(obs_month = lubridate::month(date, label = TRUE),
         obs_year = lubridate::year(date))
view(lobster_parse_date)
```

```{r}
# Yearly counts by site

lob_year <- lobster_abundance %>% 
  group_by(year, site) %>%
  count(year)

#Graph these data...

site_graph <- ggplot(data = lob_year, aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap("site")
